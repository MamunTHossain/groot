# About

  
Groot is a simple plotting and fitting package that has several GUI tools built in. It's main focus is to remain simple to allow for ease of access to use plotting graphs, histogramming for both 2D and 3D histograms and improves the accuracy of graph information to a more precise number to see the trend of numbers in a certain area, allowing you to be able to customize the type of graph to your own liking. 
  

## The Code

This is a Java development implementation using Visual Studio Code. By using Visual Studio Code, we are able to access the GUI easily with the built in plugins, which allow for the usage of SpotBugs. Using SpotBugs, we are able to swiftly identify any potential bugs in the code wherever it may be and fix them immediately. This allows us to create more reliable histograms and push future updates faster. 

# Installation
* Ensure that JDK 1.8 or higher is installed on the system.
* **[Download](https://github.com/MamunTHossain/groot/tree/master/src)** the latest version of the source files provided.
* Then add this **[library jar]**(https://github.com/gavalian/groot/raw/master/jars/) to your build path in an IDE. preferably Visual Studio Code on a Windows machine to prevent potential dependency issues. 
* Place the **src** folder (from .zip) inside the **local** folder from the path. 
* Replace all files if prompt shows up indicating "Previous files will be overwritten". 
* Install SpotBugs if you haven't already.
* To use, open the **main** folder and execute program.
* **Enter** the desired values in the GUI prompt and type of graph that is desired.

# Update 1.4

Groot is in the process of getting an updated plotting package. There will be many improvements alongside new
plotting types and newer features. The current version (version=4) has many improvements allowing to produce articles 
and presentation ready figures, supprorting PDF and SVG output.

In new version there are few new graph types, commonly used in analysis. Here is an example of Bar graph.
